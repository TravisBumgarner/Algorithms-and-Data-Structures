# Thoughts

-   Had a component where I didn't properly supply the required props and it red lined where I was using it.
-   Getting `.tsx` correct is going to take some time with muscle memory. There are some weird bugs, perhaps just with `webpack-dev-server` that cause you to have to kill the running process and restart to get things chugging along again.
-   Build will just fail if you get types wrong.

# Todo

-   Figure out how hard it is to setup Styled-Components
